* :speak_no_evil: Game over when snake's head touches another part of its body
* :hourglass: Pausing the game
* :1234: Displaying live score of the game (running time, lenght of the snake)

### Optional

* :grapes::ice_cream::banana: Different shapes of the fruits.
* :trollface: A fun snake's head
* :gear: Settings panel where you can adjust the speed, size of the board and more live
* :family: Second player's snake directed by WSAD keys
