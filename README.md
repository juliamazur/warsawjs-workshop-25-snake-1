# warsawjs-workshop-25-snake

**[WarsawJS](https://warsawjs.com/) Workshop#25**: Snake :snake: - remake of a classic mobile game in React and SVG

Playable demo: https://mhagmajer.github.io/snake-react/

## Features

### Essential

* :twisted_rightwards_arrows: Ability to move the snake's  head in the main four directions (:arrow_left::arrow_up::arrow_right::arrow_down:). The board is continuous - eg. crossing the right edge makes the snake appear on the left edge.
  * Tip: Since `onKeyDown` only works for focused elements and `svg` is not focusable, it's best to attach `keydown` event handler directly to `document`.
* :apple: Emergence of edible fruits at random time and place which make the snake grow once hit with the head. The fruit should disappear (rot) after some time.
* :speak_no_evil: Game over when snake's head touches another part of its body.
* :hourglass: Pausing the game.
* :1234: Displaying live score of the game (running time, lenght of the snake).

### Optional

* :grapes::ice_cream::banana: Different shapes of the fruits with various effects.
* :trollface: A fun snake's head.
* :gear: Settings panel where you can adjust the speed, size of the board and more while the game is being played.
* :family: Second player's snake directed by WSAD keys.
* :arrow_right_hook: Ability to turn snake's head by an arbitrary degree.
* :camera: Export screenshot of the game's board to an .svg file
  * Tip: `ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup`
* :bulb: Your ideas!
